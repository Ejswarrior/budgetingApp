# Overview
This app is designed to take in your expenses. I have a hard time think about when I should or should not by something. Most of the time I buy it. 
The goal for this app is to alert you when something you would like to purchase will bring you over your budget. The first part of the project will be a webpage 
where you can enter in your budget and expenses. This will take into account bills by having a due date. You will be able to enter in a price and the web app will say if this will bring you over your desired limit. The second part of this project once the first part is complete will be to transform it into a broswer extenstion. The idea will be if you add something to the cart it will get the price and check if it is within your budget.
